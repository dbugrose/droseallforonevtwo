All For One Build

Description:

The "All for One" Assignment is a comprehensive project that consolidates the mini API endpoints challenges into an 11-page web application. The front end is built with Tailwind CSS, resulting in a user-friendly, cohesive, and responsive interface for each API endpoint.

In addition to the Home Page, the following Mini-Challenges are included in this project:

1.) Say hello, 2.) Adding, 3.) Asking Questions, 4.) Greater or Less 5.) Madlib 6.) Odd or Even 7.) ReverseIt (alphaNumeric) 8.) reverse it (numbersOnly) 9.) Magic 8 Ball 10.) Restaurant Picker 


Daniel Herrera Peer Review - 
Notes:
Add For all pages: Add some vertical padding between text, input fields, and buttons! (Your content looks a little too squished together!)

Magic 8 Ball:
Your title should be Magic 8 ball instead of asking questions
When I input a question with a question mark, I get back “Please enter a valid question.” and when I dont input anything, I get back a response!
I see an error in the console that appears sometimes after hitting reveal your fate button and press enter in the input field!

See it there is a way for the background image to be centered when going to mobile! 

UPDATE: All of the concerns noted in the peer review have been addressed.-->
